# EVGP Battery Drain Simulator

## Description
The EVGP Battery Drain Simulator is a tool designed to predict electric vehicle (EV) battery drain. It uses input data such as position, current, and voltage, along with the characteristics of the battery and kart, to run a prediction algorithm. The simulator estimates the energy consumed and converts this into a battery percentage, providing a comprehensive output to the user.

The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the simulation by adjusting parameters such as vehicle mass and observing the battery drain behavior through real-time visualization.

## Installation and Usage
To run the application, clone the GitHub repository and navigate to the PredictionApp folder in the terminal. Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run "npm install" to install the required packages. Once packages are installed, run "npm start" to begin hosting the application locally. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ using a browser to use the application. To stop the local application, type `ctrl+c` in the terminal.
